      Annie is wiry and quick, with patchwork clothes pieced together from salvaged materials. Her hair is often tucked
      under a cap or scarf, and she always carries a worn but reliable vibroknife at her side.        
  - title: Background
    content: >-
      Annie grew up on the fringes of Haven, surviving by scavenging parts and supplies in the maintenance tunnels and
      forgotten sections of the biodomes. Resourceful and scrappy, she’s learned how to outwit bullies and bargain with
      pirates. Her sharp instincts make her a natural at finding trouble—and occasionally getting out of it. She says
      her father is a ship captain who will return after his current voyage, but most who know her believe that she is
      an orphan.
