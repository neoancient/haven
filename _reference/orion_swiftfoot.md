  - title: Appearance
    content: >-
      Orion has a roguish smile and tousled hair, wearing a patched flight jacket and carrying a customized blaster.
      His boots always seem dusty, as if he’s just stepped off another wild adventure.
  - title: Background
    content: >-
      Orion made his name running contraband through blockades and dodging patrols. He’s quick with a joke and quicker
      with his reflexes, making him one of the best pilots in the Borderlands. Though he prefers to keep things
      lighthearted, his past sometimes catches up with him.
