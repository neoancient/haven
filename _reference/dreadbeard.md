    content: >-
      Dreadbeard is an imposing figure with a mechanical arm made of polished steel and intricate engravings. His
      bushy black beard is streaked with gray, and he wears a long coat reinforced with armored plating. His eyes
      gleam with menace, and he keeps his cybernetic limb in pristine condition as a grim reminder of his past.
  - title: Background
    content: >-
      Once a respected fleet commander, Dreadbeard turned pirate after a bitter betrayal cost him his ship, his crew,
      and his left arm. He rebuilt his reputation in the Borderlands and carved out a new life in Haven. Ruthless yet
      fair, he commands loyalty from his crew and fear from his enemies.
  - title: Dreadbeard's Dogs
    content: >-
      Dreadbeard's two cybernetically-enhanced mastiffs are known as Fang and Shadow. Fang is a massive, muscular mastiff with
      a fearsome appearance. His fur is a dark shade of brindle, and his powerful jaws are filled with sharp, gleaming teeth.
      Fang's size alone is enough to deter most adversaries, and his deep, rumbling growl sends shivers down the spines of
      those who dare to challenge his master. Despite his imposing demeanor, Fang is incredibly protective of Dreadbeard and
      his crew, fiercely guarding them against any threats. Unlike Fang, Shadow possesses a sleek and stealthy demeanor. Her
      coat is jet black, allowing her to blend into the darkness with ease. Shadow is swift and agile, capable of silently
      maneuvering through the shadows, making her an ideal companion for stealthy operations. With her keen senses, she
      detects approaching danger before it's too late, alerting Dreadbeard and the crew to potential threats. Shadow's loyalty
      to Dreadbeard is unwavering, and she is always by his side, ready to defend him with her swift and precise strikes.
