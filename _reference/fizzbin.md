    content: >-
      Fizzbin is short and wiry, with mechanical goggles that magnify his eyes and stained coveralls bristling with
      tools and spare parts. His fingers are often stained with grease, and he has a small mechanical rat drone that
      scurries at his feet.

    content: >-
      Fizzbin is a brilliant, if erratic, inventor who grew up tinkering with discarded tech in Haven’s scrap yards. His
      creations are often ingenious, though not always reliable. He makes a living repairing ships and hacking systems,
      but he’s always chasing the next big idea—or the next explosion. He is seldom found very far from [Annie](annie.html).
